	<p>Question 1:<strong>Give an example of color picker input.</strong></p>
	<p>Answer:<strong>An example of color picker input would be &lt;value&gt;, which sets or returns the value of a color picker. An example we did in class of a full color picker is: &lt;label for="co"&gt;Select a color:&lt;/label&gt;
					&lt;input type="color" name="co" id="co"&gt;
				</strong></p>
	<p>Question 2:<strong>What is the use of name and value attributes? Give two examples</strong></p>
	<p>Answer:<strong>&lt;name&gt; and &lt;value&gt; can both be used to differentiate different tags. For example, &lt;meta name="Author"&gt;saves a name to the page of a program. Value allows for certain numbers or other changing ideas to be specified such as in the case of &lt;text&gt;, where the inital value of the input field will be saved. </strong></p>
