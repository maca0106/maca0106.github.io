	<h2>Question 2 - What is Version control and give an example.</h2>
	<p> Version control records changes to the file so you can pull up specific versions later. This helps especially when trying to do big complex projects later so you can go back to earlier versions if thereâ€™s a mistake for testing.  </p>
	<!-- New thought, so seperating out the two paragraphs to make it easier to read. -->
	<br>
	<p> An example of this is github, as you can save versions of it for use later. </p>
